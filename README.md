# Cloak-of-invisibility
Consists of 2 python files.
First the background.py file needs to be run.
It is to capture the image of the background and saves the image in jpeg format in the same folder as the file.
Then the invisible_cloak.py file has to be run for different types of cloaks.
Make sure all the files are in the same folder.
NOTE: Only works on RED color.
