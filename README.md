# Cloak-of-invisibility

###  Inspired by Harry Potterâ€™s Invisible Cloak, I did code implementation to make red objects into an invisible cloak </br>
<ol>
  <li>This consists of 2 python files. </li>  
  <li>First the background.py file needs to be run.  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is to capture the image of the background and saves the image in jpeg format in the same folder as the file.  </li>  
     </ul>
  <li>Then the invisible_cloak.py file has to be run for different types of cloaks.  </li>
  <li>Make sure all the files are in the same folder.  </li>
</ol>
